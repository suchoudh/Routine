I also have a small booklet to write my experiences. and improvements therein  

=== 
I have recentlyy mapped them to the folder numbers concept which has been phenomenal for me 
I am quite sure new relationships will emerge from it over time 

=== 


Next to do 
==========
Implement Today vs Yesterday concept 
Show only files that are not updated today and in right sequence without extra details ( only file names maybe ) 
have also created a folder 3400 just for settng up Routine in proper format which i guess is pretty important stuff. 
Aliases need to be moved to their own script for settign up 

Need a Helper info sheet for day2day work
