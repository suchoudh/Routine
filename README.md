1) Mind does not work alone. Body and Mind Exist together Need of kashyap Routines need to be followed esp of early bath and pooja and proper excercise. 

2) This world you consider to be outside is what is your playground. your Kurushetra. Do not try to run away from it Embrace it. 

3) Do not take yourself seriously. Its all a game ( for Her) Make it worth watching ( for Her) 

4) Cleanliness and Being Presentable are my Weaknesses need to pay special attention to both of them 

5) Pooja decide your place and time and stick to it. for predecided days / weeks / months.

at the end of the day its about 
	Performance 
	and 
	Results 

Performance is what was the effort you put in What did you put in what time you put in With whom you put in .. how you put in .. 
and than there is result ...
		when the world brings its contribution as well to the Stone Soup and makes it Wonderfully tasty. 
-- 
So Consolidate your pointers that you note in terms of two levels 
    How was your performance today 
	What is the result that you are getting.

	need to chop chop work in 20 or 40 min cycles and use that time in pomodoro to get things done in a faster way 
	Accept that you get up late and it is your disposition. 
	Use Zettlekasten to do the contacts work This will work like a miracle.
